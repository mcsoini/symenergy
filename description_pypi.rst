=============================

Symbolic modelling of energy systems, based on SymPy.

SymPy provides a framework for the structured solution of cost-optimization of energy systems using 
the standard Lagrange multiplier approach. The result consists in the close-form
analytical solutions to the optimization problem. For example, the energy production
from a power plant is expressed as
a function of the vector of symbolic parameters. These solutions are evaluated
for certain parameters in order to identify relevant constraint combinations.
